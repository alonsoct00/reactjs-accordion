Props
The Accordion component accepts the following props:

items (array, required)
An array of objects, each representing an item in the accordion. Each object should have the following structure:

question (string, required): The question to be displayed.
answer (string, required): The answer to the question.
className (string, optional)
Custom CSS class name to apply to the root Accordion component.

Styling
The Accordion component uses SCSS for styling. You can customize the appearance of the accordion by modifying the provided SCSS styles.

Customization Tips
.accordion: This class represents the entire accordion. You can adjust its width or add other styles to control the accordion's appearance.

.accordion-item: This class represents an individual accordion item. You can modify the border, margin, or other properties to change the spacing and appearance of each item.

.accordion-question: This class styles the question section of each item. You can adjust padding, cursor, and other properties to control the question's appearance.

.accordion-answer: This class styles the answer section that appears when an item is open. You can customize padding, margin, and other properties to control the answer's appearance.

Feel free to experiment with these styles to match the accordion's look and feel to your project's design.

Note: Remember to compile the SCSS styles into CSS and import them appropriately into your React components.

By using the Accordion component, you can easily create interactive and space-efficient sections for presenting information in a user-friendly manner. Customize the component's content and style to seamlessly integrate it into your React applications.
